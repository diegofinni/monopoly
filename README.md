## About
See [15-112 Project Gallery](http://www.krivers.net/15112-f18/gallery.html)

My 15-112 Project is a online multiplayer Monopoly game. It is meant to be played
on a server run on a personal computer and can host up to 4 clients on a single
match. 

The rules of the game are slightly modified from that of the original
monopoly in order to suit a more cutthroat and less forgiving style of gameplay.
Not buying a property will put it on an auction, chance now teleports you a
random number of spaces, the community chest will either give you or fine you
several hundred dollars, and has a small chance to give you an unowned property.
Also going to jail now doesn't make you miss a turn, rather it just fines you.

My 15-112 Project is a online multiplayer Monopoly game. It is meant to be played
on a server run on a personal computer and can host up to 4 clients on a single
match. The rules of the game are slightly modified from that of the original
monopoly in order to suit a more cutthroat and less forgiving style of gameplay.
Not buying a property will put it on an auction, chance now teleports you a
random number of spaces, the community chest will either give you or fine you
several hundred dollars, and has a small chance to give you an unowned property.
Also going to jail now doesn't make you miss a turn, rather it just fines you.

To run this game you will essentially have to install everything in my TP folder
other than the design proposal file. The server file sets up the server that
the clients connect to, and the client file runs all the logic and GUI of the
game. The pictures for the pieces and other decorations I put in the game are
all saved as pngs in the folder as well. Lastly, it is crucial to have the
"saves.json" file in the folder named exactly like that so that you can save
unfinished matches.

To run the game, first open your terminal on the computer that you want to run
the server, set your HOST variable (line 12) equal to your IP address, and run
the server file. Then, use the same IP address for the HOST variable (line 20)
on any of the client files, and then run them. Make sure you do not start the
game on any client before all clients have joined.
